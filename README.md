# Swagger Play Integration

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.

Swagger-play is an integration specifically for the Play framework.

### Versions

Play has many versions with breaking incompatibilities.  It does not follow Semver and therefore the Swagger Play module is split up into several different directories.

Please see the project [Root Folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-play) for the various Play versions.

Other Swagger-Play integrations
-------
This Swagger-Play integration allows you to use [Swagger annotations](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X) on your Play actions to generate a Swagger spec at runtime. The libraries below take different approaches to creating an integration.

* [iheartradio/play-swagger](https://github.com/iheartradio/play-swagger) - Write a Swagger spec in your routes file
* [zalando/play-swagger](https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger) - Generate Play code from a Swagger spec
